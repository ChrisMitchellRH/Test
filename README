This is a test of Githubbery.

Dear Mat, please add some text below, and then repost this to the original location.

Dear Chris, I've added text and have reposted this as you so directed.


now i've added this as a separate branch, thinking maybe this is how we could do our daily work. branch, edit, commit, push... merge? i don't know. also, not sure how to indicate 'i'm working on page 26, don't mess with it.'
